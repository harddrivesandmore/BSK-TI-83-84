Some updates to this project now that I'm actually working on it again, as well as answering some questions you might have.
1: Where have you been?!
I've been busy. I have been focused on school work all the time and frankly I forgot this existed.

2: I remember seeing this on the Buckshot Roulette subreddit! Where did that post go?
Long story short, Reddit flagged my account as a bot and deleted all my posts, and also shadowbanned my account. I got it appealed, but a few days later they shadowbanned me again, refused to take any appeals, and deleted my account when I reached out. I had to make a new account, and you can now find me under u/catofbacon (yes, not as creative as my old username, I know).

3: You said something about a version for the TI-86 and TI-92 series. Where is it?
I actually have a mostly fully working version for the TI-86 that I made a while back, complete with a debug mode (It's still in there. I forgot to remove it and I don't want to as it's helpful for people making their own version. The 92 and 83 versions don't have a debug mode yet.), bad code that will most likely RAM crash your calculator while being impossible to understand, and 4 billion variables. At least they are not single letter (The TI-83, as far as I know, only has single letter variables. ~~I have not done anything for the TI-92 yet. Sorry~~ The TI-92 version has been finished. I would like to say that one of my friends suggested I make a version for the TI-84+ CE, ~~so I will see about doing that~~ that version is currently in development.

4: Will you keep working on this?
I think so. I won't update it a lot, but I will try and make new versions. Heck, I might make it for more then just calculators.

5: More then just calculators you say?
Yes! I did try making a version for my C64 a while back, but I don't really have any way to save it and I could not figure out the random number generator on it. Perhaps that's my fault for using a real C64 instead of an emulator, but I did not think of that when I tried. Maybe I'll try writing it in bash or something. I am trying to get better at programming, after all.

6: Anything else?
If you're still keeping up with this repo over a year later and looking out for updates, it means a lot to me, and I really appriciate it. Thank you <3
~~Also, I lost my TI-link cable. I have a rough idea of where it is. I should probably go find it so I can upload the TI-86 version.~~ I found my link cable. Don't worry.
