# BSK-TI-83-84
Buckshot Roulette, now on the TI-83+ and TI-84+ series of graphing calculators!

Feel free to make whatever changes you want, but please don't overwrite the original file, I'd like to keep it as a master copy for people to mess with. Please put your versions in the Community folder :)
This game should be able to run on both the TI-83+ and 84+ graphing calculators. I have not tested it on the TI-83 (non plus model), but it might work.
This game will NOT run on a TI-86/85, or the TI-92 and TI-89 family of graphing calculators. They use a different programming language. I will try to make versions for those calculators if I can, but you are also welcome to try.

HOW TO INSTALL ON YOUR GRAPHING CALCULATOR:
1: Plug your graphing calculator into your computer. On the 83+ series you will need a special cable to do so, on the 84+ series you will need a micro-USB cable.
2: Install TI-connect (for windows) or TILP (for Linux) if you have not done so already.
3: Use TI-connect (or TILP if you are using that) to transfer the BSK.8xp file to your graphing calculator. Generally it should be drag and drop, but you might need to read the manual if this is your first time doing this kind of stuff.
4: Have fun :)

I did not make Buckshot Roulette, it was originally made by Mike Klubnika. All I did was turn it into a text based game for a graphing calculator.

Some updates to this project now that I'm actually working on it again, as well as answering some questions you might have.
1: Where have you been?!
I've been busy. I have been focused on school work all the time and frankly I forgot this existed.

2: I remember seeing this on the Buckshot Roulette subreddit! Where did that post go?
Long story short, Reddit flagged my account as a bot and deleted all my posts, and also shadowbanned my account. I got it appealed, but a few days later they shadowbanned me again, refused to take any appeals, and deleted my account when I reached out. I had to make a new account, and you can now find me under u/catofbacon (yes, not as creative as my old username, I know).

3: You said something about a version for the TI-86 and TI-92 series. Where is it?
I actually have a mostly fully working version for the TI-86 that I made a while back, complete with a debug mode, bad code that will most likely RAM crash your calculator while being impossible to understand, and 4 billion variables. At least they are not single letter (The TI-83, as far as I know, only has single letter variables. I have not done anything for the TI-92 yet. Sorry. I would like to say, however, that one of my friends suggested I make a version for the TI-84+ CE, so I will see about doing that.

4: Will you keep working on this?
I think so. I won't update it a lot, but I will try and make new versions. Heck, I might make it for more then just calculators.

5: More then just calculators you say?
Yes! I did try making a version for my C64 a while back, but I don't really have any way to save it and I could not figure out the random number generator on it. Perhaps that's my fault for using a real C64 instead of an emulator, but I did not think of that when I tried. Maybe I'll try writing it in bash or something. I am trying to get better at programming, after all.

6: Anything else?
If you're still keeping up with this repo over a year later and looking out for updates, it means a lot to me, and I really appriciate it. Thank you <3
Also, I lost my TI-link cable. I have a rough idea of where it is. I should probably go find it so I can upload the TI-86 version.
