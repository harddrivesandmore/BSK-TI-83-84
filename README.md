# BSK-TI-83-84

Update: TI-92(+) and TI-86 versions now out!
Buckshot Roulette, now on the TI-83+, TI-84+, TI-86, and TI-92+ series of graphing calculators!

Feel free to make whatever changes you want, but please don't overwrite the original file, I'd like to keep it as a master copy for people to mess with. Please ~~put your versions in the Community folder :)~~ make a fork with your changes and I'll check it out!
This game should be able to run on both the TI-83+ and 84+ graphing calculators, as well as the + model of the TI-92. I have not tested it on the TI-83 (non plus model), but it might work.

The files for the TI-83/84+ TI-92 and TI-86 are different. For the TI83/84+ you want the `BSR.8Xp` file. For the TI-86 you want the `BSR.86p` file. For the TI-92 you want the `main.bsr.92p` file

HOW TO INSTALL ON YOUR GRAPHING CALCULATOR:
1: Plug your graphing calculator into your computer. On the 83+ series you will need a special cable to do so, on the 84+ series you will need a micro-USB cable.
2: Install TI-connect (for windows) or TILP (for Linux) if you have not done so already.
3: Use TI-connect (or TILP if you are using that) to transfer the appropreate file to your graphing calculator. (.8Xp for TI-83/84+, .86p for TI-86, and .92p for TI-92(+)) Generally it should be drag and drop, but you might need to read the manual if this is your first time doing this kind of stuff.
4: Have fun :)

I did not make Buckshot Roulette, it was originally made by Mike Klubnika. All I did was turn it into a text based game for a graphing calculator.

Changes made with release of TI-86 and TI-92 versions: Improved dealer AI, it no longer guesses and now knows what shells remain. It still does not know the order, but it can now make an informed choice and should even know what the last shell is. The TI-92 build also has comments. Way too many comments in fact because I had nothing better to do.
The old builds file contains... well, an older build of the game. If the updated versions don't work (they did on my calculators so unless something went wrong when I got them off they should work), you can use that in the meantime as, even though the message in the version info says "may contain bugs", it's actually quite stable.
If there is any problem with the new builds at all, even if it's a typo in a line of text, file a bug report and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
