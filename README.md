# BSK-TI-83-84
Buckshot Roulette, now on the TI-83+ and TI-84+ series of graphing calculators!

Feel free to make whatever changes you want, but please don't overwrite the original file, I'd like to keep it as a master copy for people to mess with. Please put your versions in the Community folder :)
This game should be able to run on both the TI-83+ and 84+ graphing calculators. I have not tested it on the TI-83 (non plus model), but it might work.
This game will NOT run on a TI-86/85, or the TI-92 and TI-89 family of graphing calculators. They use a different programming language. I will try to make versions for those calculators if I can, but you are also welcome to try.

HOW TO INSTALL ON YOUR GRAPHING CALCULATOR:
1: Plug your graphing calculator into your computer. On the 83+ series you will need a special cable to do so, on the 84+ series you will need a micro-USB cable.
2: Install TI-connect (for windows) or TILP (for Linux) if you have not done so already.
3: Use TI-connect (or TILP if you are using that) to transfer the BSK.8xp file to your graphing calculator. Generally it should be drag and drop, but you might need to read the manual if this is your first time doing this kind of stuff.
4: Have fun :)

I did not make Buckshot Roulette, it was originally made by Mike Klubnika. All I did was turn it into a text based game for a graphing calculator.
